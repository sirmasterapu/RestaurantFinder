This is a web application that allows for users to search for restaurants based of a term and location of their chosing. 
These results can be ordered, saved, and shown in their favorites section. In order to do this I implemented using an SQL database.
Do to using a SQL database a script, StartDatabaseScript.sql which is provided, must be ran prior to running the program.
Additionally you must input your own mySQL username and password in the following files:

  SearchFavoritesServlet.java: line 49
  
  LoginServlet.java: Line 45
  
  SearchDetailsServlet.java: line 63
  
  SignUpServlet.java: line 73
  
  AddFavoritesServlet.java: line 33
  
  GoogleLoginServlet.java: line 40
  
  
  
After making the following changes and running the SQL script you may start the Java application.
